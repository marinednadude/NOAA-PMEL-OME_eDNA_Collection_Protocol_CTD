# BACKGROUND

## Summary

Water collection and filtration protocol using sterivex filters to collect envirnomental DNA from marine ecosystems. This collection and filtration protocol is used by the NOAA PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology (OME) Group.


## Method description and rationale

This protocol describes the collection and filtration of seawater samples through a 0.22 µm sterile filter capsule to capture eDNA and DNA-containing particulates. DNA will later be extracted from these samples for multi-locus metabarcoding. The protocol is intended for water collected with a niskin bottle mounted on a ship-deployed CTD rosette sampler.


## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol has been used to filter eDNA from tens of thousands of sea water samples taken from coastal stations off the western coast of North America in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean (primarily off California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska). Samples collected range in depth from surface ocean (epipelagic biome) to just off bottom (benthic biome) at varying distances from shore (coastal to off-shelf).
## Personnel Required

One person with pipetting experience. Recommend research vessel experience, but not required.

## Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions including wearing PPE should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to bleach and ethanol.

## Training requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique and pipetting technique) is required to conduct this protocol. Experience with going to sea and sample collection under seagoing conditions is encouraged, at a minimum personel should be trained in the filtering protocol in a laboratory/docked ship setting beforehand.

## Time needed to execute the procedure

The time needed varies widely based on the number and type of samples collected. For a majority of our sampling, three samples are collected from a single niskin rosette/CTD cast at three depths (e.g., surface, 30m, and 10m off bottom). The depth of collection and number of samples affects the time required - for instance a cast to 30 m may take 10 minutes, while a cast to 600 m may take over an hour. The time estimate provided in the MIOP of 375 minutes (6.25 hours) reflects an average cast and filtration time for three casts each collecting three samples (15 total samples). Each cast and filtration of three samples takes approximately 75 minutes (1.25 hours).

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

## Sampling

### Preparation

**Glove Sterilization:**
When sterilizing any equipment or filtering, sterile nitrile gloves must be used. Gloves directly from the box are not considered sterile. To sterilize, squirt 10% bleach solution from a squirt bottle onto new pair of gloves and rub hands together, then squirt with EtOH to get rid of bleach residue. Nitrile gloves should be worn at all times during the sterilization, sampling, filtering, preservation and storage steps.

**Bucket Sterilization:**

1. Create 10% bleach solution directly in bucket (4-6 L). Seal lid carefully and shake for 2-3 minutes.
2. Empty the 10% bleach solution. Fill carboy with 3-4 L of RO water and shake for 1-2 minutes. Repeat this RO wash step two more times (= 3 rinses in total)
9. Once complete, close the bucket with a lid, label, and close with tape.

**Carboy Sterilization:**
Recommend completing before embarking onto the vessel, preferably back in the laboratory environment. Similar process can be complete with squirt bottles. **Only required if you are bring carboy of RO into the field.**

1. Create 10% bleach solution directly in carboy (4-6 L). Close the carboy, make sure the spigot is closed, and shake for 2-3 minutes.
2. Empty the 10% bleach solution via the spigot into the sink. Allow 50-80% of the bleach solution to leave through the spigot, then dump the rest. You’ll need to loosen the cap a bit, otherwise, an airlock will prevent the flow. 
5. Fill carboy with 3-4 L of RO water and shake for 1-2 minutes. Repeat this RO wash step two more times (= 3 rinses in total)
9. Once complete, seal the carboy lid and spigot with parafilm. If using immiedately, fill with RO water. Otherwise, this sealed, sterile carboy can be stored for month+.

**Bottle Sterilization:**
One sterile bottle is required for each sample and each negative control.

Bottle Sterilization Method (RO Available):

1. Create a 10% bleach solution in one of the buckets (6-10 L total, depending on needs).
2. Fill 4-6 bottles at a time with 10% bleach solution; fill to the top and seal with a lid. Allow to sit for 15 minutes.
3. Pour 10% bleach from these bottles into the next set of bottles or reuse bleach for further sterilization needs.
4. Each bottle needs to be rinsed with  RO three times. Fill each Nalgene bottle with ~200 mL of RO, and then shake for 30-45 seconds (3x total).
5. Shake out excess RO dumped (doesn’t need to be entirely dry), close it with the cap, and then wrap the top with parafilm to maintain sterility. Always wrap in the direction the cap tightens, so clockwise.

Bottle Sterilization Method with (RO Not Available):

1. Complete Step 1-3 from Bottle Sterilization Method (RO Available)
2. Close it with the cap then wrap the top with parafilm to maintain sterility. **Shouldn't be done more than 24 hours in advance of sampling**
3. Once the CTD is on deck, take bleached 1 L Nalgene bottles and dispense ~250 ml of sample seawater from the Niskin into the bottle; close the lid and shake vigorously. Dump. This will rid the container of residual bleach. Repeat process 2x (= three rinses in total). Water must come from the same Niskin that will be the source of the actual sample; otherwise, there will be cross-contamination.

**Tubing and Adaptor Sterilization:**

Barbed Luer Adaptor Sterilization:
1. Place luer adaptors in a clean 50 mL Falcon tube and fill with 10% bleach. 
2. Allow adaptors to sit in bleach for 10 mins, shaking several times throughout.
3. Rinse 3x with RO water while shaking if available. If no RO is available, rinse individual adaptor in sample seawater from the niskin 3x immediately before sampling.

Tube Sterilization Method (RO Available):
1. Prepare a 10% bleach solution in one of the buckets (6-10 L total, depending on needs). Then grab two sterile buckets and fill one with RO water (6-10 L total, depending on needs). Leave the other sterile bucket for peristaltic tubing storage post-sterilization.
2. Soak the peristaltic tubing in the bucket with bleach for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the peristaltic tube. Best way to ensure the tube is filled is by rolling up the tube, and then making sure both openings are submerged. Air bubbles should escape as the tube fills.
5. Before transfering to the RO bucket, make sure to run bleach again through the tubing before transferring to RO.
6. Soak the peristaltic tubing in the bucket with RO for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the tube.
7. Before transfering sterile peristaltic tubing to sterile storage bucket, make sure to run RO water again through the tube.

Tube Sterilization Method (RO Not Available):
1. Complete Step 1-2 from Tube Sterilization Method (RO Available), minus the bucket filled with RO water.
2. Soak the peristaltic tubing in the bucket with bleach for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the tube. Best way to ensure the tube is filled is by rolling up the tube, and then making sure both openings are submerged. Air bubbles should escape as the tube fills.
3. Remove peristaltic tubing from bleach bucket and wipe down ends with kimwipe and 70% EtOH. Place in sterile storage bucket. **Shouldn't be done more than 24 hours in advance of sampling to avoid tube damage due to bleach residue**
4. Once the CTD is on deck, with a sterilized Nalgene bottle, collect ~250 ml of Niskin sample seawater in addition to the 1 L Nalgene bottle sample. Before filtering through the sterivex, run the 250 ml of sample seawater through the peristaltic tubing to clean off residual bleach. Use tubing immediately.

**Bench Space Preparation:**
* Anchor the peristaltic pump and carboy to ship bench using screws/eye bolts or bungee cords.
* Sterilize the workstation by wiping surfaces with kimwipes and a 10% bleach solution before every sampling event. If the workspace surface is wood, use the tabletop covering to cover the sample processing area.
* Optional but encouraged: store items that can easily tip/fall in rough seas in an anchored container such as a tupperware or crate to prevent falling and contamination.
* Aliquot molecular grade EtOH into a 50mL Falcon tube - pipette from this when filling sterivex cartridges to avoid contaminating the stock EtOH bottle. 

**Immediately Before Sampling:**
* All sterile fittings should be left in the packaging until ready to use. 
* Organize your peristaltic tubing, water catchment bucket (if no sink is available), and sterivex filters for all samples at a station prior to collection. 
* Pre-label whirl-paks with sample number and pre-label the ziplocks with the cast number, location, date, etc.
* Make a small boat of folded aluminum foil on which to rest the clean end of your peristaltic tubing (with the barbed luer adaptor) between samples

**Field Notebook:**

When eDNA sampling in the field, there should be a corresponding field notebook. On larger cruises where CTD logs are kept after each cast, record the sample # in the logs in the corresponding Niskin row. Then, in the field notebook, record the date, sample #, depth, and cast # in the field notebook. Any other associated notes should also be recorded here, such as filtering issues, time before filtering (if longer than ~1 hour), etc. 

On smaller cruises where no CTD logs are kept or water is sampled without a CTD, more detail is required in the field note. Record the date, sample #, site name, lat/long, cast #, depth, and any other associated notes (e.g., filtering issues, sampling device, cast deployment time).

### Sampling
This protocol is designed for samples collected with a niskin bottle - the samples are expected to be descrete and sealed masses of water that can be transferred to a 1 L Nalgene bottle without contamination (typically from the spout/spigot of the niskin bottle). For our samples, niskin bottles are remotely triggered to close at a specified depth and collected alongside complementary hydrographic data (using a CTD attached to the niskin sampling rosette). 

- Fill 1 L Nalgene bottle with 1 L of seawater. It is important to do this before the sample seawater has sat on the deck in the sun. After collecting, if you don’t have time to filter, label, and store bottles in the fridge (4˚C) for up to 12 hours (>4 hours is not ideal). Note the length of time a seawater sample sits in the fridge in the field notebook.



### Filtration

**Method 1: Sample seawater is drawn through the sterivex via tubing attached to the outlet. The sterivex inlet is submerged in the sample seawater and then pumped through the sterivex so only filtered water enters the tubing. With this method, the same tubing can be used for all samples taken from a single site (i.e. at different depths). Method 1 is preferred both for decreased tubing usage and reduced risk of contamination.**

- Remove a sterile peristaltic tube from the sterile bucket and insert into the slot in the  pump. Place one end in a bucket or sink, and insert a barbed luer adaptor into the other end. During this process, keep the tubing on the adaptor side off the counter to avoid contamination (i.e., use aluminum boat). 
- Remove sterivex from packaging - avoid touching inlet or outlet. Attach to sterile peristaltic tubing by screwing the sterivex outlet into the barbed luer adaptor (be careful not to overtighten, the sterivex outlet can break).
- Stick the inlet end of the sterivex into the sample seawater in the Nalgene bottle - do not to submerge the sterivex entirely. If the junction between the sterivex outlet and tubing is submerged, sample seawater can get sucked into the tubing, bypass the filter, and as a result, contaminate the tubing and reduce the sample seawater volume passed through the sterivex.
- Outflow can be directed to the sink or bucket. Start the pump at 35 rpm and adjust upwards accordingly so that the sample seawater takes 7-10 minutes for a sample with low turbidity.
- Once all is filtered, continue pumping until all water is removed from the sterivex. Remove the sterivex from the tubing and immediately cap the outlet with a sterivex cap. Capping the outlet prevents EtOH from leaking out in the next step. Place the section of tubing with the barbed luer adaptor your clean aluminum foil boat.

**Method 2: Sample is pushed through the sterivex via tubing attached to the inlet. The end of the tubing is submerged in the sample seawater and sample seawater passes through the tubing before entering the sterivex. With this method, a new sterile piece of peristaltic tubing is required for each sample.**

- Remove a sterile peristaltic tube from the sterile bucket and insert into the slot in the  pump. This tube will only be used for a single sample and should be replaced between each filtered seawater sample.
- Remove sterivex from packaging - avoid touching inlet or outlet. Attach to peristaltic tubing by pushing the sterivex inlet into the tubing end closest to the sink or bucket.
- Stick the other end of the peristaltic tubing into the seawater sample in the Nalgene bottle.
- Outflow with the attached sterivex can be directed to the sink or bucket. Start the pump at 35 rpm and adjust upwards accordingly so that the sample seawater takes 4-7 minutes for a sample with low turbidity. Ensure that the sterivex is securely held and the sterivex outlet does not rest in the sink or bucket edge.
- Once all is filtered, continue pumping until all water is removed from the sterivex cartridge. Remove the sterivex from the peristaltic tubing and immediately cap the outlet with a sterivex/syringe cap. Capping the outlet prevents EtOH from leaking out in the next step.
- Move the bottle and peristaltic tubing into a dirty pile to avoid reuse.

### Sample preservation

- Using a 1000 uL pipettor, gently push the tip into the sterivex inlet to make a seal (important!) and slowly push 1000 uL of 100% molecular grade EtOH into the sterivex filter. Repeat step with a new tip, so the total volume in the sterivex is 2000 uL.
- Cap the sterivex inlet with a sterivex/syringe cap. Once sealed, shake the sterivex to ensure all sides of the filter paper have been saturated with EtOH.
- Label outside of sterivex with eDNA sample number.
- Put the entire sealed cartridge into a small labeled whirl-pak. Place all sterivex from a single site (replicates or samples taken at different depths in a single niskin rosette/CTD cast) into a single gallon plastic bag. Store in -20˚C freezer.

### Storage

Store preserved samples in a -20˚C freezer for the duration of the cruise. When transporting preserved samples, the most ideal condition is a cooler with ice packs so they remain below freezing. OME preserved samples are shipped (freezer to freezer) in under 24 hours and kept with frozen ice packs at all times. 

Any issues with storage should be noted. Samples **may potentially** remain preserved if briefly thawed to refrigeration temperature (4˚C) and returned to freezing temperatures within 24 hours. 

## Quality control

A field negative control consisting of sterile RO water in a pre-filled and sealed (prior to fieldwork) 1L bottle is filtered at the start and end of a cruise using new sterile peristaltic tube and fittings. If more than 50 samples are collected on a cruise, an additional negative control is filtered every 50 samples. 

## Basic troubleshooting guide

**Issue 1:** Clogged filter.

Solution : If a sterivex clogs prior to filtering 1 L (water no longer passes through and is ejected out the side of the inlet/adapter fittings), then denote the volume filtered and continue filtering through a new sterivex. Repeat until 1 L is filtered. Mark each additional sterivex, record additional sample names and notes, and denote volumes filtered for each in the field notebook.

**Issue 2:** Broken filter inlet or outlet.

**Solution:** If broken during filtering, stop filtering, record volume filtered, and denote damage. Next, use parafilm and label tape to seal the broken outlet/inlet of the sterivex. Store in whirlpak. Sample might be salvagable. Remove any peristaltic tubing, bottles, etc. contaminated by sample seawater or sterivex contents from the field of sampling.

## GLOSSARY

| SPECIALISED TERM | DEFINITION |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Field negative control | Sampling negative control. Typically distilled or reverse osmosis water run through a filter like an seawater eDNA sample to control for contamination in the field sampling step.  |
| Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor | Sensor used to measure temperature, conductivity and pressure. Additional sensors are often attached to the frame of the deployable CTD frame (oxygen, chlorophyll, pH, etc.) to collect additional data. Often, niskin bottles are attached to the same deployable metal frame as the CTD and ancilliary sensors so that water parameter data are collected alongside niskin water samples. Deployments of this suite of instruments and sensors on the same frame is often referred to as a "CTD cast". |
| Niskin bottle  | Plastic cylindrical bottle of varying volumes for collecting descrete water samples. A stopper at each end of the bottle can be "cocked" open with an electronic or weight triggered release mechanism causing the stoppers to snap shut. This is remotely triggered so the bottle closes at a prescribed depth. Often, multiple bottles are arranged on the same frame as a CTD and other sensors in a "rosette". |
